      <h2>Origin: Kolkata, West Bengal, India</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Kolkata in a business family, where I saw firsthand how capable businesses can struggle not because of lack of effort, but because of limited access to structured guidance and informed decision-making. Watching my father and uncle navigate complex operational and financial challenges without formal advisory support shaped my desire to understand how businesses work as interconnected systems rather than isolated functions. Coming to the United States, I wanted to be part of something larger than myself, working on problems where thoughtful analysis and clear reasoning can meaningfully change outcomes. That motivation drove me to pursue an intentionally broad education, building fluency across finance, operations, supply chains, and markets so I could develop a holistic view of how decisions ripple through an organization. I see myself as a generalist by design, someone who values depth but prioritizes integration, connecting perspectives, asking the right questions, and helping businesses move forward with clarity.

      <h2>Problems / Projects I Have Worked On</h2>

      <h3>Early-Stage Startup Strategy and Financial Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        I worked with an early-stage technology startup to bring structure to open-ended growth and monetization questions by building financial models around customer acquisition, unit economics, and long-term scalability. Through this work, I learned how strategic decisions in young companies are often constrained by imperfect data, making clarity of assumptions and disciplined trade-off analysis just as important as technical precision.
      </p>

      <h3>Client-Facing Consulting and Market Expansion Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        As part of a consulting team, I helped evaluate market entry and expansion opportunities across multiple geographies by analyzing customer behavior, performance metrics, and operational constraints. This experience taught me how to frame recommendations that balance analytical rigor with real-world feasibility and how to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders with different priorities.
      </p>

      <h3>Applied Investment and Economic Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        In an investment-focused role, I analyzed asset classes, macroeconomic trends, and portfolio structures to support decision-making for international investors navigating regulatory and market complexity. I learned how broader economic signals translate into concrete investment implications and how structured analysis can reduce uncertainty in high-stakes financial decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Research on Governance, Incentives, and Economic Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Through independent academic research, I studied how governance structures and policy frameworks shape incentives and long-term outcomes in regulated industries using historical data and economic models. This work reinforced the importance of asking precise questions, grounding arguments in evidence, and understanding the unintended consequences that policies can create over time.

      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I spend time playing the drum kit, staying active through sports like hockey, squash, pickleball, and weight training, reading across economics and decision-making, and exploring food and culture, all of which help me balance analytical rigor with creativity, discipline, and curiosity.
